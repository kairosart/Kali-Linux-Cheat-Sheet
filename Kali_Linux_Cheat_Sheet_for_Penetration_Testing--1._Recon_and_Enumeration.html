Many systems and network  administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory,  managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service  uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts  are available on the network, what services (application name and  version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS  versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in  use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly  scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on  all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are  available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.<br /><table class="table"><tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr><tr><td>nmap -v -sS -A -T4 target</td><td>Nmap verbose scan, runs syn stealth, T4 timing (should be ok on LAN), OS and service version info, traceroute and scripts against services</td></tr><tr><td>nmap -v -sS -p–A -T4 target</td><td>As above but scans all TCP ports (takes a lot longer)</td></tr><tr><td>nmap -v -sU -sS -p- -A -T4 target</td><td>As above but scans all TCP ports and UDP scan (takes even longer)</td></tr><tr><td>nmap -v -p 445 –script=smb-check-vulns
